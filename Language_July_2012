Phonology

	p'	t'	k'
	b	d
	f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ	x
		
	l/r/rr
	j/w
	
Pulmonic plosives cannot be syllable-terminal
	Hence no /g/

Lexicon
	Need a way to coin new words from compounds/phrases
		Reduce syllable count
			Ejective plosives -> Pulmonic plosives
			Vowel clusters simplified
			<strike>Simple syllables merge into vowel syllables</strike>
				In normal langauge simple syllables occur only when they cannot merge, ie all simple syllables merge when possible even in normal speech

Grammar
	Would be helpful to be able to tokenise speech into morphemes, like written spaces between words
		Morpeheme length measured in syllables
			Encoding this in opening phonemes logial but artificial and unaesthetic
			Special morpheme-initial and/or -final syllable structres?
				Often be not universally applied?
				Applies only to multi-syllable words?
				Morpheme-final structre ends with nasal-fricative combo?
				Single-syllables morphemes are not simple syllables? ie not p', m, v, etc.
